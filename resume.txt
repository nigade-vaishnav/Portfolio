 Projects
 Trapezoidal and Simpson’s Rule in C++ (Parallelized)
 2024
 Implemented numerical integration using Trapezoidal and Simpson’s Rule, parallelised using OpenMP/MPI to
 study performance gains with Amdahl’s Law. Achieved 1.6x speedup over serial implementation.
 Odd-Even Sort (Parallel)
 2024
 Designed and implemented an efficient Odd-Even Transposition Sort using MPI, analysing communication overhead
 and efficiency over increasing processors.
 Cloud-based AI/ML Pipeline with CI/CD and GPU Acceleration
 2024–25
 Built a CI/CD pipeline for training and deploying PyTorch/TensorFlow models on AWS/GCP. Containerised
 models using Docker, deployed inference APIs with Flask/FastAPI, and integrated GitHub Actions for automated
 training and deployment. Leveraged GPU acceleration for faster training and used profiling tools like nvidia-smi
 and PyTorch Profiler for performance tuning.
 Full-Stack Health Tracker (In Progress)
 Developing a personalised health wellness tracking platform using React, Node.js, MongoDB, and integrated
 AI/ML APIs for diet, screen-time, sleep, and fitness reminders.
